Implementation of [Hands-on Rust](https://pragprog.com/titles/hwrust/hands-on-rust/)

with advice from [Learn Bevy's ECS by ripping off someone else's project](https://saveriomiroddi.github.io/learn_bevy_ecs_by_ripping_off/introduction.html), but I rended up making some different choices at times. Specifically game states and stages are implemented differently.

Compared to _Learn Bevy's ECS by ripping off someone else's project_ , this implementation uses the Bevy engine for rendering and only uses bracket-lib for the Dijkstra and FOV algorithms.
